I'm a professor in the Machine Learning Group and head of the Computational and Biological Learning Lab in the Division of Information Engineering at the Department of Engineering in Cambridge. I work on machine learning and on climate change. I don't travel professionally by air because it destroys the habitability of earth.
Research

I'm interested in the theory and practice of understanding and building systems that learn and make decisions. Humans have an exceptional ability to learn from experience, which sets them apart from current artificial intelligent (AI) systems. To understand human learning and design better AI we need principled approaches to learning and decision making based on Bayesian inference in machine learning. My interests span: probabilistic inference, reinforcement learning, approximate inference (variational and MCMC), decision making, non-parametric modeling, stochastic processes and efficient learning.

My first mentor was David Willshaw; I completed my MSc with Lars Kai Hansen and PhD with Geoff Hinton.
